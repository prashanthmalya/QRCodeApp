      <p>
        I have great pride and honor to be the principal of SDC College, which
        is one of the pioneering institution that provides quality education in
        Kolar District, As a responsible citizen, my primary object is to groom
        students into a good citizens and dynamic leaders in corporate sector,
        entrepreneurs and academicians who can contribute to the development of
        the society and nation at large. I search for these treasures (students)
        from the burrows of surrounding villages. As a teacher, I believe that
        learning is not at all possible without teaching and teaching is not at
        all possible without learning. Staff and students work like hand gloves
        to make it possible.
